    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce/li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: 4 slices of cheese</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Optional: hamburger toppings - lettuce tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high)./li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder,
            and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take ¼ of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into the
            shape of a hamburger patty that is about ¾ inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the patty to
            prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4
            hamburgers.</li>
        <li>Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook an
            additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.*</li>
        <li>If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers off
            the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.
            Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.</li>
    </ol>
